# Fake-news-Classifier-using-LSTM

📌 Overview

This project is a Fake News Classification System built in Python and executed using Google Colab.
The model analyzes news articles and classifies them as FAKE or REAL using state-of-the-art machine learning and NLP techniques.

It is designed to help understand how text preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training work together to build a robust classification pipeline.

🚀 Features

Clean text preprocessing (lowercasing, stopwords removal, stemming, etc.)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

TF-IDF vectorization

Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression / PassiveAggressive / SVM / Naive Bayes)

Model evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, & classification report

Simple prediction function to classify new statements

Implemented fully inside Google Colab (no setup required)
